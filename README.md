# 📋 STAFF LIST - Project

The current AOIT staff list is **outdated**. Your task is to update it using JavaScript by correcting, removing, and adding staff members across all AOIT departments.

All updates must follow proper spelling, reflect correct (including married) names, and list each department’s staff **in alphabetical order**.

---

## 🔧 PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

- **Do NOT edit any HTML.**  
  All changes must be made using JavaScript and array methods.

- Each AOIT department contains one or more issues:  
  misspellings, duplicate names, incorrect names, or missing staff.

- **Your responsibility:**  
  Use your JavaScript skills to fix every department.

- **Team Collaboration:**  
  - Work together to verify staff information.  
  - Only *one person* per team may research department staff.

- **Department Logo**
  - Create or use an image to display an image that would represent the department.

---

## 📘 JavaScript Requirements

Your script must demonstrate use of the following:

- `array`
- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `shift()`
- `unshift()`
- `splice()`

---

## ⭐ ADVANCED CHALLENGE (+1 Point)

Complete both tasks to earn an extra point:

### 1. Use only `splice()` to modify all arrays  
Avoid using push, pop, shift, or unshift.

### 2. Create a new department: **Interns**
- Collect all intern names from Counselors and Guidance.
- Add them as a new department in your JavaScript.  
- Display the Interns list as part of the final HTML output.
